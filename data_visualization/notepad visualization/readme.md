## Data Visualization

This module provides visual insights into the Breast Cancer dataset. It includes:

- **PCA Plot:** Reduces feature dimensions to 2 for easy visualization of malignant vs benign classes.  
- **ROC Curve:** Evaluates classifier performance and helps analyze the trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.  
- **Confusion Matrix Plot:** Visualizes correct and incorrect predictions for better interpretability.  

These visualizations help understand model behavior, highlight class separability, and support evaluation of classification performance.
